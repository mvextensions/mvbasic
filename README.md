## Development Setup

To clone, develop and run the code locally you will need:

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
3. Clone the repository from GitHub (`git clone https://github.com/mvextensions/mvbasic.git`)
4. Open the cloned copy in an IDE. We'd suggest using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) because that's why we're all here right?
5. Run `npm install` from the command line wherever you cloned the project. VS Code makes this easy, with the project open just open a new terminal window in the editor.
6. Congratulations! You're setup to work on the code.

To debug, make sure you run the debugger for the following configurations (these are provided in the `.vscode/launch.json` file).

1. Launch Client
2. Attach to Server
